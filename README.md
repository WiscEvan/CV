## Evan's CV
This is the CV for Evan R. Rees.  Branches are for special versions, for a specific application, generally.

### Background
Using the template from <https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume>.  Thanks!


Originally this used https://github.com/there4/markdown-resume to make the markdown resume.
Since then I'm just using pandoc and make (with template above) to render the versions of my resume.
So I've removed references to the old method (except for above and in the commit history)
